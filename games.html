        <p>As a game developer, I strive to create experiences that are uniquely my own. Currently, my individual projects 
          all exist within the scope of Unity, C# and 2D pixelart, but I'm always pushing my boundaries and exploring new 
          ways I can create games I feel passionate about. If you'd like to see my games, please open my <a href="https://thatmolamola.itch.io">Itch.io</a>. 
          I am always pleased to hear feedback, positive or negative, from people who have given my projects their time and attention.

        <p>
          Seven Segments is the first officially published game by thatMolamola Games, and it is a puzzle strategy game themed around Seven Segment Displays. With three multiplayer modes and a single player campaign, the core basis of the game centers on illuminating segments in order to claim digits on a Seven Segment Display.

          <p>
            Mathemagica is a game protoype, similarly math themed as Seven Segments, but with a more narratively driven world. It heavily draws from RPG elements while advancing those elements in new ways, primarily by allowing the player to control their damage output via in-battle spellcrafting, in addition to battles involving imaginary HP values, forcing the player to defeat their opponents by dropping HP values to exactly zero.
