          <p>I’m the only one left in this sushi place 
            Servers keep glancing at my face
            There’s uncensored CeeLo Green, 
            six scenes on one screen
            And me, alone with them all on a Sunday night
            
            I miss my dad, more the old presence He was. 
            Not just the sake leaving me abuzz. 
            Asked if I want more
            If not, it’s the check and the door.
            “Another round then,” on a Sunday night
            
            I miss my dad, even the fresh husk he is. 
            Cannot tell what’s mine or what’s his. 
            Made me a martyr
            Left us as nonstarters
            And me, less and less, on a Sunday night
            
            That hard stuff displeases my beer gut
            But my flesh is not one to spare it
            The duels and trials
            of my distant exile
            “My last one, I swear” on a Sunday night
            
            I seek more ideas to twist
            Tap my right knuckles, soft fist
            Darkest night before dawn
            Weak end almost gone
            Me, and cute words on a Sunday night
            
            Not sure what followed drink five
            But by a dumpster I revive
            Brush aside gravel on my cheek
            As the Monday sun starts to peek 
            Me, and the false tail of a Sunday night</p>

          <p>How unfair we have so few hues
            That my memories can’t help but transfuse
            
            Why did your hair share its colors with rust
            A subtle clue how all love turns to dust
             
            How do my neighbor’s roses already know
            All the same words as your blood in the snow
            
            That wretched briquette
            I wish to forget
            And yet I’m still met with this debt at sunset
            
            I wouldn’t burn the world’s wonders away
            But can’t I keep my shades of sorrow at bay
            
            Each morning I see,
            My neighbor how she
            
            Bends down on bruised knee 
            Tends those blood blooms I see
            
            And so those secrets stay with the flowers and me</p>

          <p>I wish I could ignore
            The clothes strewn on my floor
            But they say so much more
            Than I can
            
            Oh how my scattered socks
            Do prove our walks and talks
            So when the clocks flummox
            They deadpan
            
            My pants and T’s 
            Dance as they please
            My pleas 
            But a breeze
            
            Though they defy my appeal
            After Twilight I know that we’ll 
            Enclothe our ordeals
            The floor feels
            
            Threads worn til we’re worn
            I hug them and warn
            Though others may scorn
            We’re Real</p>

          <p>Do you think that it’s Stupid
            Trying to pair with Cupid? 
            
            Even though I love you deeply,
            No matter how I coax,
            I can only finish cheaply.
            You will always hear a hoax.
            You’ve trapped me in the vortex
            Of my neo frontal cortex.
            What more do I need to say?
            
            I’ll resort to using gerunds
            and obtuse jargon in herds
            if it helps my love errands.
            Please take my bargain bin words.
            My brilliance, resilience
            I don’t dispense a lick of sense
            But for you I’ll plead some way.
            
            I would cherish you til we’re perish due.
            We would be the only two who never face a lonely view.
            
            Because although this medium 
            traps me in some tedium,
            when I see how you illuminate 
            I’m willing to ruminate. 
            If English dislikes my veneration,
            I’ll still find some stupid generation.
            
            There’s only one rhyme for me
            And I’ll phrase it so it’s you
            A fool for love I’ll be
            But at least I’m foolishly true</p>

        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>I dream of days finer than fine
            Good days unprompted by indulgence of wine
            Some say satisfaction must be sought out
            Others think the pursuit leaves you without
            It’s ok to say “It’s ok to frown”
            But how ok am I really, all the way down
            Want to want? Need to need?
            Every permutation leaves me ill at ease.
            Is poetry a way to help myself cope
            Or a crumb for a malnourished mope? 
            Maybe if I closed the blinds
            I’d seek some sunshine
            Whether I have a lot 
            Or I have a little 
            I fear I’ll feel stuck in the middle
            So many questions, no answers real, 
            I want more than this one way to feel</p>

        <button class="collapsible">"Jimmy Neutron told me this poem was shit"</button>
        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>Inter me within all my garbage
            So when I enter heaven
            My garb shortens the wait
            
            The weight of all my sinning
            Mistakes in my beginning
            But how the middle thinnens
            As flaws’ ends have yet to near
            
            Much too near my nadir
            A day near still inside me 
            This I know will sigh me 
            On some future day
            
            My mother names me humble
            And then she grumbles humbug
            Because I dare to mumble
            “It’s easy with no virtues” 
            Followed by a shrug
            
            I’d try to end this better
            But this I threw together
            Through 3 AM this morning
            Mourning our hours past
            
            Passed another minute 
            An other way to spin it
            Knitten from the loose strands
            Those thoughts left in misused and’s
            
            And so I’ll leave an ‘and’ for
            That second chance I’m after
            Til all the questions dance more
            And I finally say the ans-

          <p>A boy and a turtle and a stream
            Together, happy as sun beams
            They swim through shallow waters, 
            Sing sad songs about fathers
            A boy and a turtle and a stream
            
            A boy and a turtle in the sun
            The days, they relish one by one
            Sounds of splashing laughter
            And cozy naps right after
            A boy and a turtle and their dreams
            
            A boy and a turtle on the rocks
            Both worried, both thinking ‘bout the clock
            When will the waters cool down
            What’s happened to my hometown
            A boy and a turtle as time streams
            
            A boy and a turtle hold to hope
            Together, they help each other cope
            This isn’t what I wanted
            But won’t live a life so haunted
            A boy and a turtle and extremes
            
            A boy and a turtle and a pond
            Quiet, who knows what lies beyond
            I hope that it’s enough for you
            A lovely place, there’s room for two
            A boy and a turtle and their seams
            
            A boy and a turtle intertwined
            Those days, they had to leave behind
            I wish you were here with me
            My love is more than memory
            A boy and a turtle and a stream</p>
