        <button class="collapsible">“The Basic Server’s Dozen Tasks”</button>
        <div class="poetry-content">
        <p>We call them shifts, for work is to change
        yourself, the forks, the job we adjust and rearrange.

        The work’s much more than a waiting game, 
        it only starts with welcome and here’s my name. 

        We’re back in the business of busyness: 
        daily hosting, packing and bussing mess!

        Serving versus scores of mouths to feed,
        who knows what’s in store or what they need. 

        The doors soon open, the easy window’s closing, 
        that gentle ambiance should be composing. 

        Now time to pick up the pace, pick up the plates, 
        there’s no idle rest or want for those who wait! 

        So minus the menus of their muck and mire, 
        stack dishes, cups and lids a little higher. 

        Any glass half empty shouldn’t last, 
        lest you or your table finish fast! 

        Fill full sweet sauce from the source!
        People in my way? Prep another course!

        Want a tip? Phone it in!
        Serve the role! Gotcha grin?

        So busy I have to table this and that; 
        God forbid if customers want to chat!

        Fix disorder and that order as we slow! 
        To come here is to get theirs to-go! 

        Easy now, take a ten, fuel back up. 
        Eat a bit, remember your cup. 

        Unagi is a ready state of mind,
        for quicker eels are not left behind
        when the workload becomes unkind!</p>

        <button class="collapsible">"on feeling texture"</button>
        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>over dried ridges of acrylic
            my finger traces, idyllic
            
            in a swirling, colorful dance
            a mind and surface entrance
            
            these tender brushstrokes
            lain layers of lush cloaks
            
            across grand sweeping plains
            presence of kernels and veins
            
            another, dressed in scales
            i must resist the details
            
            even ugly guardrails I resign
            touch upon a feeling divine
            
            from rough flakes to mistakes
            i follow close to the wakes
            
            and when i’m due to depart
            my finger keeps the glimmer of art
            and the paint a piece of my heart</p>

        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>Last night I stood firm
            against that beast’s searing stare;
            I showed them no fear.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">"Maybe it's Time to Invest in Jetskis"</button>
        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>I dream of days finer than fine
            Good days unprompted by indulgence of wine
            Some say satisfaction must be sought out
            Others think the pursuit leaves you without
            It’s ok to say “It’s ok to frown”
            But how ok am I really, all the way down
            Want to want? Need to need?
            Every permutation leaves me ill at ease.
            Is poetry a way to help myself cope
            Or a crumb for a malnourished mope? 
            Maybe if I closed the blinds
            I’d seek some sunshine
            Whether I have a lot 
            Or I have a little 
            I fear I’ll feel stuck in the middle
            So many questions, no answers real, 
            I want more than this one way to feel</p>

          <p>Inter me within all my garbage
            So when I enter heaven
            My garb shortens the wait
            
            The weight of all my sinning
            Mistakes in my beginning
            But how the middle thinnens
            As flaws’ ends have yet to near
            
            Much too near my nadir
            A day near still inside me 
            This I know will sigh me 
            On some future day
            
            My mother names me humble
            And then she grumbles humbug
            Because I dare to mumble
            “It’s easy with no virtues” 
            Followed by a shrug
            
            I’d try to end this better
            But this I threw together
            Through 3 AM this morning
            Mourning our hours past
            
            Passed another minute 
            An other way to spin it
            Knitten from the loose strands
            Those thoughts left in misused and’s
            
            And so I’ll leave an ‘and’ for
            That second chance I’m after
            Til all the questions dance more
            And I finally say the ans-

          <p>My words
            don’t float like a wood thrush’s song:
            too heavy, too steady, too many, too wrong.
            
            My eyes
            don’t share how I did when I was young:
            too deep to seep beyond my tongue.
            
            The machines can dream
            more than I can;
            does that make me
            more or less of a man? 
            
            My thoughts
            emerge as cubes and spheres:
            shapes too simple to represent fears
            
            My cares
            cling to me like sweat from my pores:
            Until I’m done, how my poor portals pour
            
            These edges of my mind
            are far too defined. 
            Can I ever say
            what I’d like to convey? 
            
            I don’t know if I can cry like I used to
            I don’t think I should sigh like I’m used to
            
            Lonely years, months and days I refused to
            Admit these heavy chains I’ve been fused to
            
            Here I am, one more year, having used two 
            Here I am, all this pain, what I’ve reduced to
            Here I am, still unsure how to choose to</p>

          <p>A boy and a turtle and a stream
            Together, happy as sun beams
            They swim through shallow waters, 
            Sing sad songs about fathers
            A boy and a turtle and a stream
            
            A boy and a turtle in the sun
            The days, they relish one by one
            Sounds of splashing laughter
            And cozy naps right after
            A boy and a turtle and their dreams
            
            A boy and a turtle on the rocks
            Both worried, both thinking ‘bout the clock
            When will the waters cool down
            What’s happened to my hometown
            A boy and a turtle as time streams
            
            A boy and a turtle hold to hope
            Together, they help each other cope
            This isn’t what I wanted
            But won’t live a life so haunted
            A boy and a turtle and extremes
            
            A boy and a turtle and a pond
            Quiet, who knows what lies beyond
            I hope that it’s enough for you
            A lovely place, there’s room for two
            A boy and a turtle and their seams
            
            A boy and a turtle intertwined
            Those days, they had to leave behind
            I wish you were here with me
            My love is more than memory
            A boy and a turtle and a stream</p>
