          <p>I’m the only one left in this sushi place 
            Servers keep glancing at my face
            There’s uncensored CeeLo Green, 
            six scenes on one screen
            And me, alone with them all on a Sunday night
            
            I miss my dad, more the old presence He was. 
            Not just the sake leaving me abuzz. 
            Asked if I want more
            If not, it’s the check and the door.
            “Another round then,” on a Sunday night
            
            I miss my dad, even the fresh husk he is. 
            Cannot tell what’s mine or what’s his. 
            Made me a martyr
            Left us as nonstarters
            And me, less and less, on a Sunday night
            
            That hard stuff displeases my beer gut
            But my flesh is not one to spare it
            The duels and trials
            of my distant exile
            “My last one, I swear” on a Sunday night
            
            I seek more ideas to twist
            Tap my right knuckles, soft fist
            Darkest night before dawn
            Weak end almost gone
            Me, and cute words on a Sunday night
            
            Not sure what followed drink five
            But by a dumpster I revive
            Brush aside gravel on my cheek
            As the Monday sun starts to peek 
            Me, and the false tail of a Sunday night</p>

          <p>How unfair we have so few hues
            That my memories can’t help but transfuse
            
            Why did your hair share its colors with rust
            A subtle clue how all love turns to dust
             
            How do my neighbor’s roses already know
            All the same words as your blood in the snow
            
            That wretched briquette
            I wish to forget
            And yet I’m still met with this debt at sunset
            
            I wouldn’t burn the world’s wonders away
            But can’t I keep my shades of sorrow at bay
            
            Each morning I see,
            My neighbor how she
            
            Bends down on bruised knee 
            Tends those blood blooms I see
            
            And so those secrets stay with the flowers and me</p>

          <p>I wish I could ignore
            The clothes strewn on my floor
            But they say so much more
            Than I can
            
            Oh how my scattered socks
            Do prove our walks and talks
            So when the clocks flummox
            They deadpan
            
            My pants and T’s 
            Dance as they please
            My pleas 
            But a breeze
            
            Though they defy my appeal
            After Twilight I know that we’ll 
            Enclothe our ordeals
            The floor feels
            
            Threads worn til we’re worn
            I hug them and warn
            Though others may scorn
            We’re Real</p>

          <p>A boy and a turtle and a stream
            Together, happy as sun beams
            They swim through shallow waters, 
            Sing sad songs about fathers
            A boy and a turtle and a stream
            
            A boy and a turtle in the sun
            The days, they relish one by one
            Sounds of splashing laughter
            And cozy naps right after
            A boy and a turtle and their dreams
            
            A boy and a turtle on the rocks
            Both worried, both thinking ‘bout the clock
            When will the waters cool down
            What’s happened to my hometown
            A boy and a turtle as time streams
            
            A boy and a turtle hold to hope
            Together, they help each other cope
            This isn’t what I wanted
            But won’t live a life so haunted
            A boy and a turtle and extremes
            
            A boy and a turtle and a pond
            Quiet, who knows what lies beyond
            I hope that it’s enough for you
            A lovely place, there’s room for two
            A boy and a turtle and their seams
            
            A boy and a turtle intertwined
            Those days, they had to leave behind
            I wish you were here with me
            My love is more than memory
            A boy and a turtle and a stream</p>
