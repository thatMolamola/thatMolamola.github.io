        <button class="collapsible">“The Basic Server’s Dozen Tasks”</button>
        <div class="poetry-content">
        <p>We call them shifts, for work is to change
        yourself, the forks, the job we adjust and rearrange.

        The work’s much more than a waiting game, 
        it only starts with welcome and here’s my name. 

        We’re back in the business of busyness: 
        daily hosting, packing and bussing mess!

        Serving versus scores of mouths to feed,
        who knows what’s in store or what they need. 

        The doors soon open, the easy window’s closing, 
        that gentle ambiance should be composing. 

        Now time to pick up the pace, pick up the plates, 
        there’s no idle rest or want for those who wait! 

        So minus the menus of their muck and mire, 
        stack dishes, cups and lids a little higher. 

        Any glass half empty shouldn’t last, 
        lest you or your table finish fast! 

        Fill full sweet sauce from the source!
        People in my way? Prep another course!

        Want a tip? Phone it in!
        Serve the role! Gotcha grin?

        So busy I have to table this and that; 
        God forbid if customers want to chat!

        Fix disorder and that order as we slow! 
        To come here is to get theirs to-go! 

        Easy now, take a ten, fuel back up. 
        Eat a bit, remember your cup. 

        Unagi is a ready state of mind,
        for quicker eels are not left behind
        when the workload becomes unkind!</p>

        <button class="collapsible">"on feeling texture"</button>
        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>over dried ridges of acrylic
            my finger traces, idyllic
            
            in a swirling, colorful dance
            a mind and surface entrance
            
            these tender brushstrokes
            lain layers of lush cloaks
            
            across grand sweeping plains
            presence of kernels and veins
            
            another, dressed in scales
            i must resist the details
            
            even ugly guardrails I resign
            touch upon a feeling divine
            
            from rough flakes to mistakes
            i follow close to the wakes
            
            and when i’m due to depart
            my finger keeps the glimmer of art
            and the paint a piece of my heart</p>

        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>Last night I stood firm
            against that beast’s searing stare;
            I showed them no fear.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">"Maybe it's Time to Invest in Jetskis"</button>
        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>I dream of days finer than fine
            Good days unprompted by indulgence of wine
            Some say satisfaction must be sought out
            Others think the pursuit leaves you without
            It’s ok to say “It’s ok to frown”
            But how ok am I really, all the way down
            Want to want? Need to need?
            Every permutation leaves me ill at ease.
            Is poetry a way to help myself cope
            Or a crumb for a malnourished mope? 
            Maybe if I closed the blinds
            I’d seek some sunshine
            Whether I have a lot 
            Or I have a little 
            I fear I’ll feel stuck in the middle
            So many questions, no answers real, 
            I want more than this one way to feel</p>

        <div class="poetry-content">
          <p>Inter me within all my garbage
            So when I enter heaven
            My garb shortens the wait
            
            The weight of all my sinning
            Mistakes in my beginning
            But how the middle thinnens
            As flaws’ ends have yet to near
            
            Much too near my nadir
            A day near still inside me 
            This I know will sigh me 
            On some future day
            
            My mother names me humble
            And then she grumbles humbug
            Because I dare to mumble
            “It’s easy with no virtues” 
            Followed by a shrug
            
            I’d try to end this better
            But this I threw together
            Through 3 AM this morning
            Mourning our hours past
            
            Passed another minute 
            An other way to spin it
            Knitten from the loose strands
            Those thoughts left in misused and’s
            
            And so I’ll leave an ‘and’ for
            That second chance I’m after
            Til all the questions dance more
            And I finally say the ans-

          <p>I wish I could ignore
          the clothes strewn on my floor,
          but they say so much more
          than I can…

          Oh how my scattered socks
          do prove our walks and talks,
          so when the clocks flummox,
          they deadpan…

          My pants and T’s 
          dance as they please,
          my pleas 
          but a breeze.

          Though they defy my appeal,
          after dark, I know how we’ll 
          reveal our ordeals.
          The floor feels…

          New threads worn til we’re worn,
          I hug them close and warn
          though others may scorn.
          We’re Real.

          <p>Dust gathers over on the moons of Neptune, 
          you’d see sweeping and mopping around noon. 

          Alpha Centauri is home to crowns, mirrors and rust,
          much I can’t name; in principles we share and trust.

          In Andromeda, mothers gaze up at our Milky Way,
          considering rainbows, lyrics, and their bad day. 

          Distance changes much, but not all,
          we each learn what it means to fall. 

          You can focus on how we differ, how we mirror,
          but look where you like, we are always nearer.

          Even when we’re lonely, we are never alone. 
          The unknown has much of what we’ve known.
